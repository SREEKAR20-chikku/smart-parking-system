The ESP32 Smart Parking System uses 5 IR sensors to monitor parking slots and a servo motor for gate control. Sensors detect whether slots are occupied or free, and ESP32 calculates available spaces. The system displays status via Serial/LCD and can be extended to IoT for real-time monitoring in malls, offices, and smart cities.
